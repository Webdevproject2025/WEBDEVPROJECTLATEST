        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Judge Feliciano Belmonte Sr. High School is the youngest public high school in Quezon City, established on June 10, 2008, in response to the strong clamor of residents from Brgy. Holy Spirit. Originally an annex of Holy Spirit National High School, it gained full independence on January 28, 2009â€”the shortest transition in the history of annex school separations.
          The school sits on a 5,000-square-meter property along AFP Road, Brgy. Holy Spirit, serving over 330,000 residents in the area. Named after Judge Feliciano Belmonte Sr., a respected public servant, the institution started with 1,623 students and a team of 35 teachers under the leadership of Dr. Agapito T. Lera.
          Despite limited resources in its early days, the school thrived through the collective efforts of administrators, faculty, local officials, and the community. It has since become known for academic excellence, discipline, and a clean and peaceful environment.     
          The school also implements "Sagip Hinto sa Pag-aaral", a program supporting at-risk students by providing them with a weekly allowance to continue their education. 
          Now with over 123 teachers, JFBSHS is committed to producing globally competitive graduates and remains a symbol of progress and hope in the community.</p>
  
          <h1>MISSION</h1>
          <p>To protect and promote the right of every Filipino to quality, equitable, culture-based, and complete basic education where:
              Students learn in a child-friendly, gender-sensitive, safe, and motivating environment.
              Teachers facilitate learning and constantly nurture every learner.
              Administrators and staff, as stewards of the institution, ensure an enabling and supportive environment for effective learning to happen.
              Family, community, and other stakeholders are actively engaged and share responsibility for developing life-long learners.
              </p>
  
              <h1>VISION</h1>
              <p>We dream of Filipinos
                  who passionately love their country
                  and whose values and competencies
                  enable them to realize their full potential
                  and contribute meaningfully to building the nation.
                  As a learner-centered public institution,
                  the Department of Education
                  continuously improves itself
                  to better serve its stakeholders.</p>
